NB: for some reason the relative path format does not work in the vhdl file_open function
which means that the absolute path is to be inputted in c-IRAM.vhd and b-DRAM.vhd

1. open vsim from terminal 
2. load all the necessary files (the list is contained in sources.f
3. go to Tools -> Tcl -> Execute macro and open startsim.tcl
