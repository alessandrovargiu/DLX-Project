DLX is a RISC architecture, a simplified version of the Stanford MIPS CPU.
It is a 32-bit load/store architecture. The goal of this project is to build a DLX implementation
from scratch, using VHDL language. There are three main blocks that compose this architecture.

First (not in order of relevance), the Control Unit. The basis for our model was the microprogrammed Control Unit, which makes
use of a microcode memory that contains the control bits for each instruction.
The Datapath is another important block of the DLX. Some internal blocks, like the P4 Adder were previously created during the course laboratories
and were used for this final project. Another example is the T2 Shifter, which was shown in the course lectures and we decided to implement it.
The Hazard Unit is another component that works alongside the Control Unit, to manage the various types of hazards that could occur during the
execution of instructions in the pipeline. Later in this paper, all of its features will be explained.
